## Overview
Time series analysis is crucial for uncovering underlying patterns in temporal data, enabling accurate forecasting and decision-making in fields like finance, healthcare, and engineering. This repository provides a framework for analyzing and modeling time series data using machine learning and statistical techniques.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, resampling, and normalizing time series data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations such as time plots, seasonal plots, and correlograms.
- **Stationarity Testing**: Methods to check for stationarity, including the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test.
- **Decomposition**: Analyzing trends, seasonality, and residuals.
- **Forecasting Models**:
  - **Classical Time Series Models**: ARIMA, SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing.
  - **Machine Learning Models**: LSTM, GRU, and other neural network architectures.
- **Error Metrics**: Calculating performance metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.Usage
- **Visualization Tools**: Plotting actual vs. predicted values and confidence intervals.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/time-series-analysis.git
cd time-series-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt


## usage

- Load the dataset: Place your time series data in the data/ folder or specify its path.
- Run the analysis: Use the provided scripts to conduct exploratory analysis, preprocessing, and forecasting.

python main.py --data data/your_timeseries_data.csv --model LSTM
  
## Techniques will be Covered

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Time series plotting and seasonal decomposition.
- **Stationarity Tests**: Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test for detecting trends.
- **Modeling**:
  - **ARIMA**: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average for univariate forecasting.
  - **SARIMA**: Seasonal ARIMA for handling seasonality.
  - **LSTM/GRU**: Recurrent Neural Networks for capturing long-term dependencies.
- **Error Metrics**:
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error), RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error).
